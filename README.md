My implementation of a library for arbitrary-precision integers, based on the Seminumerical Algorithms section of Knuth's *The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2*. Inspired b
[this](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13) Project Euler problem, which involves
a sum of one hundred 50-digit integers.

Currently Implemented:
