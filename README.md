BigInt
===================================================
My implementation of a library for arbitrary-precision integers. Inspired by
[this](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13) Project Euler problem, which involves
a sum of one hundred 50-digit integers.

Currently Implemented:
- addition and subtraction
